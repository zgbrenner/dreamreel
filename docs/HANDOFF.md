# DREAMREEL — Handoff / Pick-Up Doc

_Last updated: 2026-06-23 (emotion-taxonomy expansion). Read this first when resuming._

## TL;DR — where we are

DREAMREEL is being redesigned from a tasteful old-film reel into a **chaotic, fluid, multi-modal,
Finnegans-Wake-style stream of consciousness**. As of 2026-06-23, **wake mode is the default
experience**; the classic three-clock reel is now opt-out via **`?wake=0`**. The redesign is well
advanced — all merged to `main`:

- **Chaos engine + fluid layering** (rounds 6/3): a seeded `intensity` heartbeat drives sporadic
  layer-swaps, breathing N-layer density (`LayerStack`), and rare **coherence troughs**.
- **Dream-filter catalog** (round 2): mood-axis-selected filters (kaleidoscope, liquid, solarize,
  melt, posterize, feedback echo-trails).
- **Uncanny image corpus** (round 1): CLIP-embedded public-domain images.
- **Moving image / video** (round 4): short, muted, looping public-domain film clips as first-class
  visual assets.
- **Wake-mode "pacing + restraint" polish** (2026-06-23, PR #20): a large live-feel tuning pass on
  owner feedback — calmer/widened cadence, more+longer lucid moments, far more (7×) and longer-held
  (9–13 s) **video that is pinned visible while it plays**, **content-aware clip frames** (CLIP
  avoids title cards/logos), much less distortion/flicker/old-TV/feedback, **cross-faded layer
  swaps**, and less on-screen text.
- **Sampled audio as a first-class medium** (round 5, 2026-06-23, merged `main` `4c573bc`): a second
  Infinite-Jukebox walk in **CLAP** space (`dream/audioWalker.ts`), **text-bridge-coupled** to the
  on-screen visual (each visual asset carries a `claptext` vector), mixed over the untouched synth bed
  by a Tone bus graph (`audio/mixer.ts`: music/foley/voice/film-clip buses + ducking + bounded
  `AudioPool`). Plays in **both** classic and wake, behind the existing sound/archive toggles.
  Determinism preserved: audio picks fire on **logical visual beats** (`dream/audioCadence.ts`), not
  wall-clock. Film clips now ship **with** their native soundtrack (ducked in when a clip is the hero).
- **Single-verb UX** (2026-06-23, `main` `fc1af01`): the viewer can only summon a **new dream** —
  no dream-shaping controls. Surreality + tempo are now derived from the seed (`dream/seedParams.ts`),
  not user knobs; the UI is just **New dream / play-pause / sound on-off**. Shareable state reduced to
  **`?seed=`** only (`?wake=0` remains a non-UI engine-mode opt-out). Store no longer holds
  surreality/tempo/archive.
- **Emotion-taxonomy expansion to 12 blendable axes** (2026-06-23, *data + types + docs only — NOT
  yet wired to visuals/audio/text*): added **love, loss, joy, fear, absurdity, strange** to the
  original six CLIP mood axes. Mood is a continuous, blendable vector over all axes (never a single
  label). New helpers `dominantAxes` + `blendMoods` in `dream/mood.ts` for later prompts. The filter
  catalog is deliberately still pinned to the original six (`filterDirector.ts` `FILTER_AXES`); the
  new axes are inert until a later wiring prompt. See "Emotion taxonomy — next steps" below.

- Live app: **https://dreamreel.pages.dev** (**wake by default**; add **`?wake=0`** for the classic
  three-clock reel). **Production deploys from `main`** via Cloudflare Pages Git integration.
- Production manifest: `VITE_MANIFEST_URL` on Cloudflare Pages (prod **and** preview) →
  `https://pub-0f361adf4c4d425198bd06d2d9ab5194.r2.dev/manifest/latest.json`. **Now serving
  v`2026.06.23-1515`: 326 visual assets (277 PD images + 40 film clips + 9 procedural) + 42 texts +
  `claptext` on every visual asset, plus a `44`-clip `audio[]` pool (16 music / 14 voice / 14 foley),
  `audioEmbeddingDim 512`.**

## Wake-mode tuning surface (where to nudge the live feel)

All wake-mode; all deterministic (constants/thresholds + dt/clock-driven, no new RNG draws). Current
values after the 2026-06-23 polish:

- **Pacing / cadence** — `dream/conductor.ts` `wakeTick` swap interval
  `(0.4 + (1 - intensity) * 1.6) / max(0.5, tempoMul)`, **×2 when `s.inTrough`** (lucid moments
  linger). Faster as intensity rises.
- **Lucid moments (coherence troughs)** — `dream/intensity.ts`: `TROUGH_MIN_GAP 14`,
  `TROUGH_MAX_GAP 30`, `TROUGH_DUR 4.0`, `TROUGH_RAMP 1.0` (more frequent + longer than the original
  22–46 s / 2 s). Trough kind split is 50% rhyme / 40% lucid / 10% phrase (`dream/coherence.ts`).
- **Video frequency** — `dream/dreamwalker.ts` `TYPE_WEIGHTS = { video: 7.0 }` (multiplies the
  pre-softmax weight; ~11% of the pool → majority of picks).
- **Video linger + visibility** — `conductor.ts` `swapWakeLayer` sets `slotHeldUntil[slot] =
  clock + (inTrough ? 13 : 9)`; `pickSwapSlot` (`dream/slotHold.ts`) skips held slots; held slots
  are **pinned visible** via `LayerStack.applyPlan(plan, pinnedSlots)` (pinned non-hero forced to
  ≥0.72 opacity). Concurrent decoders capped at 3 (`render/Compositor.ts` `VideoPool`).
- **Distortion** — `dream/filterDirector.ts` strength scale `(0.10 + 0.32 * intensity)`,
  `TROUGH_EASE 0.08`; `capDistortion` clamps the two geometry-manglers (`kaleidoscope ≤ 0.3`,
  `liquid ≤ 0.45`); film warp `conductor.ts` `min(1, intensity² * 0.3)`.
- **Feedback "breathing" echo-trail** — `render/LayerStack.ts` `fbMat.opacity = feedbackTrail * 0.55`.
- **Old-TV grade / flicker** — `conductor.ts` `baseWakeFilm()` (vignette 0.16, grain 0.06, sepia
  0.08, scanline 0.02, desat 0.08, halation 0.05, haze 0.03, **flicker 0.02**); `filmGrade
  0.38 - intensity*0.25`; `bloom 0.10 + intensity*0.18`. Flicker math is in `render/postfx.ts`.
- **Layer-swap blending** — swaps cross-fade over ~0.3 s via `LayerStack.update(dt)` +
  `fadeTarget`/`fadeOpacity` (no more hard cuts).
- **On-screen text frequency** — `dreamwalker.ts` `pCard = 0.02 + (lastLeaped ? 0.05 : 0) +
  surreality*0.03`; phrase-trough threshold `coherence.ts` `0.9`.
- **Curation cutoffs** — `dream`/pipeline: image `DEFAULT_CUTOFF 0.52`, **video `VIDEO_CUTOFF 0.45`**
  (`pipeline/embed/curate.py`).

## What's left to do

### Immediate / decisions for the owner
- ✅ **Wake mode flipped default-ON** (2026-06-23). `app/src/state/url.ts` `readShareState` now
  defaults `wake` to `true` unless `?wake=0` / `?wake=false`. Unit test updated (`url.test.ts`); the
  smoke spec now covers classic via `?wake=0` and wake as the bare-`/` default.
- ⚠️ **Photosensitivity hardening** — now the top remaining gate, since wake (with its flicker/
  feedback/strobe-capable layers) is the default the public lands on. `IntensityEngine` has a single
  `setMaxIntensity` clamp (reduced-motion already clamps to 0.45) — needs a proper strobe/flash-rate
  cap + possibly a warning gate. Flicker is now low (0.02 in wake) but this is the remaining safety gate.

### Emotion taxonomy — next steps (the wiring prompts)
The 12-axis mood vector now exists end-to-end (offline → manifest → runtime types), but the six
**new** axes (love/loss/joy/fear/absurdity/strange) are carried in data only — nothing reacts to them
yet. This was deliberate (the expansion prompt was data+types+docs). Remaining wiring work:
- **Visuals:** extend `dream/filterDirector.ts` beyond `FILTER_AXES` (currently the original six) so
  the new emotions select/scale treatments. CLAUDE.md's "Mood-mapped filter catalog" documents the
  original six 1:1 mappings — agree new mappings (or blend-based selection) before changing it.
- **Audio:** `audio/params.ts` `bedParamsFor` reads only a few named axes; decide how love/joy/fear/etc.
  reshape the bed (and whether the CLAP audio walk should bias on the new axes).
- **Text:** the drifting/intertitle text could be selected/tinted by the dominant emotional blend.
- Helpers ready to consume: `dream/mood.ts` `dominantAxes(mood, k)` (top-k without collapsing the
  blend) and `blendMoods(moods, weights)` (per-axis weighted average — e.g. tender+loss = bittersweet).
- **Real-corpus reship:** the live R2 manifest (`v2026.06.23-1515`) still has 6-axis moods. A reship
  via `pipeline/embed/build_manifest.py` (real CLIP) will re-project all assets onto the 12 axes — do
  this before the wiring lands so production assets carry the new axes. (The committed dev seed
  `app/public/manifest.seed.json` is already 12-axis; the generator `app/scripts/gen-seed.mjs` is
  updated too, but a raw regen still drops the augmented `vid-seed-0` + `audio[]` — pre-existing
  generator limitation, so the seed was migrated additively rather than regenerated.)

### Round 4 — Video (✅ SHIPPED, content-aware frames)
Pipeline: a video is sourced by sampling several interior frames and using CLIP to pick the one
**least like a title card / studio logo / archival notice** (`pipeline/embed/frame_selector.py` —
`build_avoid_vector` + `select_best_frame`); that chosen timestamp drives BOTH the embedding poster
AND the clip start (threaded download → `fetched_videos.jsonl` `clip_start_seconds` → manifest
internal `_clipStart` → `publish/transcode_video` `-ss`, stripped before R2). Degrades gracefully to a
single ~30% frame (`pipeline/embed/clip_window.py` `clip_start_seconds`/`probe_duration`) when CLIP
text-scoring or ffprobe is unavailable. Renderer: `render/videoTexture.ts` (`loadVideoTexture`,
muted/looping/fail-safe) + `render/VideoPool.ts` (cap 3, restart-at-0, reduced-motion freeze, pauses
on dream-pause, dispose-driven teardown) + `Compositor.showVideo` + conductor `video` branch (wake
**and** classic). Muted/visual-only — film audio is round 5. **Live: v`2026.06.23-0359`, 40 clips**;
the 0.45 cutoff kept all 40. Specs/plans: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-round4-video-design.md`,
`…/plans/2026-06-22-round4-video.md`, plus the polish round
`…/specs/2026-06-23-wake-pacing-restraint-design.md`, `…/plans/2026-06-23-wake-pacing-restraint.md`,
and `…/plans/2026-06-23-wake-polish-r4.md`.

### Round 5 — Sampled audio (✅ SHIPPED)
Sampled sound (music / voice / foley) is a first-class medium alongside the synth bed. A second
Infinite-Jukebox walk runs in **CLAP** embedding space (`dream/audioWalker.ts`, seeded `seed+":audio"`),
**text-bridge-coupled** to the on-screen visual: every visual asset carries a precomputed `claptext`
CLAP-text vector, and each audio pick's softmax is biased toward audio whose CLAP embedding aligns with
the current logical visual's `claptext` (so sound relates to image). Picks are mixed over the synth bed
by `audio/mixer.ts` — a Tone bus graph (music/foley/voice/film-clip buses) with pure ducking math
(`audio/ducking.ts`, voice ≈ film-clip > music > foley > bed) and a bounded `audio/AudioPool.ts`
(cap 3). The mixer is built lazily in `conductor.play()` (needs the engine's Tone master, which only
exists after `audio.start()`), gated on a non-empty `audio[]`. Film clips now ship **with** their
native soundtrack (`publish/transcode.transcode_video_with_audio`, no `-an`), ducked in when a clip is
the hero. **Determinism:** audio picks fire on **logical visual beats** via the pure
`dream/audioCadence.ts` accumulator (NOT wall-clock dt) — so the audio asset *sequence* is a pure
function of the seed (a unit test compares two dt chunkings). 141 vitest + e2e + 83 pytest green.

**CLAP embedding reality:** `laion_clap` won't build on Python 3.13, so the corpus pass uses
HuggingFace **`transformers`** CLAP (`laion/clap-htsat-unfused`, 512-d) via the operational-only
`pipeline/audio/clap_transformers.py` (audio decoded ffmpeg→48 kHz wav→soundfile; verified semantic).
The unit-tested `pipeline/audio/clap_backend.py` stays `laion_clap`-or-hash so CI needs no model.

**Corpus build/reship (operational, from `pipeline/`, ffmpeg on PATH):**
```bash
# 1. fetch PD audio (Archive.org: Great 78 / LibriVox / NASA), trim per-kind w/ intro-skip,
#    real-CLAP embed audio + claptext for every visual asset, AUGMENT the live manifest in place
python -m audio.build_corpus --manifest out/manifest.json --out out --music 20 --voice 15 --foley 15
# (review out/manifest.json — drop any objectionable PD items; a Nazi-anthem 78 was removed by hand)
# 2. validate against the app's zod loader
cd ../app && npx tsx scripts/validate-manifest.ts ../pipeline/out/manifest.json
# 3. upload ONLY the new audio + the augmented manifest (visual media on R2 untouched)
cd ../pipeline && R2_ACCOUNT_ID=… R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=… R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=… \
  R2_BUCKET=dreamreel-media R2_PUBLIC_BASE=https://pub-0f361adf4c4d425198bd06d2d9ab5194.r2.dev \
  python -m audio.ship_corpus --manifest out/manifest.json --out out
```
`build_corpus.py` augments the existing manifest (keeps every visual asset's exact embedding + R2 src,
only adds `audio[]` + `audioEmbeddingDim` + per-asset `claptext`); `ship_corpus.py` uploads just the
44 audio `.m4a` (content-type `audio/mp4`) and pushes `manifest.<version>.json` + `latest.json`,
popping internal `_local`.

**Deferred (non-blocking):** *bed-under-samples ducking is a documented no-op* — the mixer's `bed`
bus carries no source (the synth engine's bed isn't rerouted through it), so `busGainsDb`'s bed trim is
inert. Wiring it needs an engine bed sub-bus; voice/film-clip-over-music/foley ducking + the master
sound mute all work. Per-kind UI toggles, beat-sync, and a coupling-strength URL knob were YAGNI'd.

### Known deferred Minors (non-blocking, from reviews)
- ✅ **Held-clip swap-frame lag** — FIXED (2026-06-23). `wakeTick` now runs the discrete events
  (coherence trough + layer swap) BEFORE `stack.update(dt)`/`captureFeedback`, so a freshly-set fade
  target eases the same frame instead of one late. The two `walker.next()` calls (coherence text →
  swap image) keep their order, so the deterministic sequence is unchanged.
- ✅ **`LayerStack.resize()` not wired** — FIXED (2026-06-23). `Compositor` now exposes
  `addResizeListener()` (a multi-listener mirror of `addFrameListener`, alongside the single-slot
  `onResize` held by post-FX); `LayerStack` registers in its constructor and unsubscribes on dispose,
  so its feedback render targets track window resize. Covered by a new vitest in `layerFade.test.ts`.
- ✅ **Stale "Task N" / "prompt N" comments** — FIXED (2026-06-23): scrubbed the build-order
  references in `render/LayerStack.ts`, `render/Compositor.ts`, `render/filmParams.ts`, `audio/engine.ts`.
- `frame_selector` leaves candidate frames in `out/posters/_cand` (one-shot offline pipeline; harmless).

## Architecture pointers

- **The brain (pure, seeded, unit-tested):** `dream/intensity.ts` (heartbeat + troughs),
  `dream/coherence.ts` (trough kinds), `dream/layerPlan.ts` (density bands), `dream/filterDirector.ts`
  (mood→filter strengths + `capDistortion`; reacts to `FILTER_AXES` = the original six),
  `dream/mood.ts` (12-axis `projectMood`/`blankMood` + `dominantAxes`/`blendMoods` helpers),
  `dream/seedParams.ts` (seed→surreality/tempo), `dream/dreamwalker.ts` (embedding walk +
  `TYPE_WEIGHTS`), `dream/slotHold.ts` (`pickSwapSlot`). No `Math.random` in the dream path.
- **The renderer:** `render/LayerStack.ts` (N-layer feedback compositor; cross-fade `update(dt)` +
  pinned-slot visibility), `render/videoTexture.ts` + `render/VideoPool.ts` (video), `render/DreamFilter.ts`
  (5 fragment filters), `render/postfx.ts` (EffectComposer: DreamFilter → FilmEffect grade → bloom →
  chroma; flicker), `render/filmParams.ts` (FilmParams), `render/Compositor.ts` (single rAF loop).
- **The audio medium (round 5):** `dream/audioWalker.ts` (CLAP jukebox walk + text-bridge bias +
  per-kind `TYPE_WEIGHTS`, pure/seeded), `dream/audioCadence.ts` (pure logical-beat pick cadence —
  the determinism guard), `audio/mixer.ts` (Tone bus graph + ducking + film-clip routing, built lazily
  in `play()`), `audio/ducking.ts` (pure dB policy), `audio/AudioPool.ts` (bounded decoders), over the
  existing `audio/engine.ts` synth bed. Conductor advances the walk in both `imageBeat()` (classic) and
  `swapWakeLayer()` (wake), reading that beat's `claptext`.
- **The integration:** `dream/conductor.ts` — `wakeTick(dt)` drives everything each frame from the
  intensity sample + mood; `swapWakeLayer` does the layer swaps + video holds; the classic 3-clock
  path is untouched and runs when `wake` is off.
- **The pipeline:** `pipeline/ingest/` (Openverse + Wellcome + Met/Smithsonian + Archive.org, license
  gate), `pipeline/embed/` (CLIP via `clip_backend`, `download` images+videos, `frame_selector` +
  `clip_window` for video frames, `curate`, `build_manifest`), `pipeline/audio/` (CLAP backend +
  hash-fallback `clap_backend` / transformers `clap_transformers`, `transcode_audio`, license-gated
  `ingest`, `build_audio` + `claptext`, operational `build_corpus`/`ship_corpus`), `pipeline/publish/`
  (transcode webp/mp4 + film-clip-with-audio mp4, upload to R2, strip internal `_local`/`_clipStart`,
  rewrite `src` to CDN).
- **Determinism contract:** same `?seed` → same asset/text/coherence **sequence** (timing + cosmetic
  recipe may vary). The video weight is a deterministic scalar; holds/fades are clock/dt-driven.
- Specs + plans: `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` (one pair per round).

## How to run / verify

- **See wake mode (deployed):** `https://dreamreel.pages.dev/?wake=1`, or a branch preview like
  `https://<branch-with-dashes>.dreamreel.pages.dev/?wake=1`.
- **Local with real media:**
  ```bash
  cd app
  VITE_MANIFEST_URL="https://pub-0f361adf4c4d425198bd06d2d9ab5194.r2.dev/manifest/latest.json" npm run build
  npm run preview -- --port 4173 --strictPort
  # open http://localhost:4173/?wake=1
  ```
- **Tests:** `cd app && npm run test` (vitest, ~141), `npm run typecheck` (**`tsc -b --noEmit`** — the
  build-mode typecheck; plain `tsc -p` misses project-reference errors), `npm run lint`,
  `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright smoke; covers `?wake=1` and now constructs the audio mixer via a silent
  data-URI foley in the dev seed). Pipeline: `cd pipeline && python -m pytest -q` (~83).
- **⚠️ Smoke gotcha:** Playwright's `reuseExistingServer` will reuse a stale `npm run preview` on
  **port 4173** and silently test an OLD build (false-green). Kill any process on 4173 before
  `npm run test:e2e` (a real run rebuilds and takes ~60s; a <15s run reused a stale server).
- **⚠️ Pipeline test:** `pipeline/tests/test_carry_through.py` fails LOCALLY if `torch` is installed
  (the real CLIP embedder can't decode the test's fake jpg). CI's torch-less venv passes. Run the
  suite as `python -m pytest -q -k "not carry_through"` locally. Not a bug.
- **⚠️ ffmpeg/ffprobe required** for the video AND audio pipeline (poster frames + transcode + audio
  trim/decode). Not always on PATH; on Windows it was installed via `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` and
  lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Gyan.FFmpeg_*\ffmpeg-*\bin` — prepend to PATH.
- **⚠️ Audio corpus deps:** `audio.build_corpus` needs `transformers` + `soundfile` (real CLAP) and
  `audio.ship_corpus` needs `boto3`. `pip install transformers soundfile boto3`. First CLAP use
  downloads the `laion/clap-htsat-unfused` checkpoint (~600 MB). Runtime needs none of this — all
  embeddings ship precomputed in the manifest.
- Round 5 spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-round5-audio-design.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-22-round5-audio.md`.

## Rebuild the corpus + re-upload to R2

The downloaded films/images are cached under `pipeline/out/` (and `out/candidates.jsonl` from ingest),
so a re-pick/re-embed/re-ship does NOT need to re-ingest:

```bash
cd pipeline
export PATH="<ffmpeg-bin>:$PATH"
# R2 env: R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_BUCKET, R2_PUBLIC_BASE (non-secret, below) + R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
python -m embed.download --candidates out/candidates.jsonl --out out   # re-pick video frames; images/films cached
python -m embed.build_manifest --out out                              # re-embed (images stable, videos from new frames)
python -m publish.run --out out --upload                              # transcode + upload + rewrite src + strip internal keys
```

A full fresh build (re-ingest included) is `make corpus` then `make corpus UPLOAD=1` with the R2 env.
The R2 endpoint is derived from `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` (there is no `R2_ENDPOINT_URL`). Non-secret vars:
`R2_ACCOUNT_ID=e1377b90aa5f91b18522fc40df57afc3`, `R2_BUCKET=dreamreel-media`,
`R2_PUBLIC_BASE=https://pub-0f361adf4c4d425198bd06d2d9ab5194.r2.dev`. The two API keys are secret
(create an R2 API token with Object Read & Write in the Cloudflare dashboard; the secret is shown once).

## Infra / accounts

- GitHub: `zgbrenner/dreamreel`. CI = `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (app typecheck/lint/vitest/build/
  license-scan; pipeline pytest + license gate; manifest-contract validates pipeline output against the
  app's zod loader). Cloudflare Pages deploys via Git integration (production on `main` + per-PR
  previews); NO deploy GitHub Action. Playwright smoke runs in CI on `main`.
- Cloudflare: Pages project `dreamreel`; R2 bucket `dreamreel-media` (public r2.dev URL, CORS allow
  GET `*`, not publicly writable; custom domain not set up — swap `R2_PUBLIC_BASE` if one is added).

## Appendix — earlier-round history

### Rounds 1 & 2 build notes (history)
1. **Media → R2 publish pipeline** (PR #13): builds web derivatives, correlates `asset.id`→local file,
   uploads to R2, rewrites `asset.src` to CDN URLs. Offline tests with mocked boto3.
2. **Round 6/3 — Wake chaos engine** (PR #14): the seeded intensity signal + `LayerStack` compositor +
   coherence troughs. Behind `?wake=1`.
3. **Round 2 — Mood-mapped filter catalog** (PR #15): 6 filters by dominant CLIP mood axis, strength
   scaled by the intensity heartbeat, eased at coherence. Identity (no filter) by default.

### Round 1 corpus — uncanny re-curation (shipped 2026-06-18, PR #16)
Retargeted the offline pipeline at a genuinely uncanny corpus. Shared theme catalog
(`pipeline/ingest/themes.py`): `CLINICAL` / `OCCULT` / `LIMINAL` veins + `ANCHOR_THEMES` (always
kept). New **Wellcome Collection** ingester (`pipeline/ingest/wellcome.py`); Met + Smithsonian +
Wellcome on by default. Mood-score curation (`pipeline/embed/curate.py`) drops images whose
`max(uncanny, ominous) < 0.52` (anchors exempt). First uncanny corpus shipped as v`2026.06.18-2208`
(223 images); superseded by the current v`2026.06.23-0359` build (277 images + 40 video clips).
Under-returning veins to deepen later (optional): alchemical diagram, spirit photography, specimen,
deep-sea creature — thin in Openverse/museum APIs; add synonyms or target an Archive.org collection.
